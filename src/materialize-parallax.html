                  I'm a recent graduate of UNC Chapel Hill. A long time local of Chapel Hill, I first became
                  interested in technology while building desktops for fun in middle school, and expanded upon that
                  fascination by later earning a CompSci B.S. as well as participating in UNC Chapel Hill's Full Stack
                  Javascript Bootcamp. I've fallen in love the abstraction and power programming provides, and web
                  development opens up even more creative avenues to build useful software.

                  Computing has held a life-long fascination for me. What
                  started as an interest in building my first computer
                  developed into a growing desire to understand how a
                  compilation of simple ideas and components can interact to
                  produce a complex and adaptable entity. I have always found
                  Video games and interactive websites enticing. When I browse
                  a skilfully designed website, it peaks my curiosity and I
                  want to understand how the engineers wrote such a flawless
                  code. This fascination is what drove my decision to join the
                  UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp to make coding my career as
                  a web developer.

                  I just like to know how things tic. As a young electrical engineer I regularly came across cases
                  where the ability to develop web apps and aggregate API data would have been invaluable. This pushed
                  me into teaching myself basic coding, which eventually evolved into the desire for a more formal
                  foundation. This lead to my enrollment at UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp. I am truly looking
                  forward to leveraging my previous knowledge and experience with the coding skills currently being
                  developed in all future endeavors.<br><br><br>

                  I have always found technology and, by association, coding exciting.
                  After more than ten years working in various pharmaceutical laboratories as a chemist,
                  I'm hoping to turn an old hobby into a career. This led to my enrollment in the UNC 
                  Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp and I'm interested in seeing where these new skills will take me.
